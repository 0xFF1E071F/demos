This is not an introsystem, neither it is a tool nor the
source code of any intro. This is a base code or framework
that you can use to build your own introsystem. 
It contains:
 
* Initialization code for OGL, with extensions for compressed textures, shaders, and FBOs
* A fully functional texture generator
* Code for loading DDS files/arrays to textures
* A basic timing scheme for timing scenes to elapsed time.
* Support for linking against MSVCRT.DLL, not chunky runtimes like MSVC2010's
* Small footprint (compresses to 13 or so kb, last time I checked)

To use, modify the intro_* files to hook into your relevant effects/shaders/routines. 

Special thanks go to Inigo Quilez [http://www.iquilezles.org], for which this framework is based on.
